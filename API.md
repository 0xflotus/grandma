# API Doc

## Alpha notice

**This project is still in its very early stages. I am still working on the MVP and the project is not yet ready for use. If you would like to see what is happening, I encourage you to look at the [MVP milestone](https://github.com/catdad/grandma/milestones/mvp).**

**I reserve the right to break any of the APIs presented here without notice, until the `0.1.0` release, at which point, I will begin following semver.**

This document is currently meant for me to record the current or desired API, and is subject to change before it is moved to the proper [README.md](README.md) file.

## Run

```javascript
var grandma = require('grandma');

```

## Report

grandma.report();
