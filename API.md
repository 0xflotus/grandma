# API Doc

## Alpha notice

**This project is still in its very early stages. I am still working on the MVP and the project is not yet ready for use. If you would like to see what is happening, I encourage you to look at the [MVP milestone](https://github.com/catdad/grandma/milestones/mvp).**

**I reserve the right to break any of the APIs presented here without notice, until the `0.1.0` release, at which point, I will begin following semver.**

This document is currently meant for me to record the current or desired API, and is subject to change before it is moved to the proper [README.md](README.md) file.

## Run

```javascript
var grandma = require('grandma');

grandma.run(/* TODO */);
```

## Report

Options:
* `input`: readable stream of report data generated by `grandma.run`.
* `output`: writable stream to output the report to.
* `plot`: text, json, or plot. Default is text.

Text example:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var input = fs.createReadStream('/path/to/a/grandma.log');
var output = process.stdout; // print to the console

var grandma = require('grandma');

grandma.report({
    input: input,
    output: output
}, function(err) {
    if (err) {
        console.error('something went horribly wrong', err);
    } else {
        console.log('the report was written to the output stream');
    }
});
```

Plot example:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var input = fs.createReadStream('/path/to/a/grandma.log');
var output = fs.createWriteStream('/path/to/a/report.html');

var grandma = require('grandma');

grandma.report({
    input: input,
    output: output,
    type: 'plot'
}, function(err) {
    // ...
});
```

## List

_Note: it really seems like this should not be an API. All it does is take an array of objects and returns an array of the `name` property of those objects. That's stupid. It really needs to just be a CLI command._

```javascript
var grandma = require('grandma');

grandma.list(/* TODO */);
```
